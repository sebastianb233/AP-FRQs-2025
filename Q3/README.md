## Question 3 Analysis
### Matches

This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Array/ArrayList Algorithms):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Same stragety to start the code while reading the question.
- For this question i was very calful to rereade all of the key conceps becuase it was one of the most difficuls solution i got.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I realize that i did make a lot of mistakes, however i beliave that i did them becuase the wording of this question was very hard.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Using for, while, or enhanced for-each loops
- Starting from specific indices
- Using helper variables (e.g., counters, accumulators, flags)
- Using .get(), .set(), .add(), .remove(), .size()
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned that i have to be more careful and also fro next time i have to prepare more for reading and undertanding.
