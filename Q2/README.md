## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Same approach as i was reading i started to create the class so i didnt have to go back in case in forgot what i had to do.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I realize that i was very strong with creation of class becuase where i remember of what i put in the exam is mostlitly the same.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Creating instance variables
- Writing constructors
- Writing or completing methods
- Proper encapsulation (using private fields and public methods)
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned that i was very string in class contruction.
