# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Sebastian B*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included:
   - Sincerely dont use the Princtons book because it has some typos and it my get you all confused, also is better if you are prepering with a software that provides feedback in order to see your mistakes and learn from them.
   - Ap classroom questions are very helpful becuase your are getting use to the types of questions that you will see in the Ap exam and you will be much comfortable whent you take the Ap test, just like it happend to me :).
   - Take your time for studing thinks that you may not remenber or what you still have questions about, and please use AI for your advantage.
   - I took the opportunity to ask Mr Hans what i had questions on in any topic.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were:
  - Time management is the number one thing i stuggle with becuase time goes so fast that you cant take the time you would like or need to answer the question but, my best advice is to move on if you are really stuck so you can at least finish all question.
  - Another advice is to not leave question black becuase you may get it right or maybe you can get partial credict.
  - Another straggle that i had is the pressure while taking the test. Is very important that you stay calm and dont feel overwhelm becuase that does not let you think properly in order to get the right answer.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me:
   - Is that if you get really stuck in a question move on so you can finish others question and maybe you will have time to do others questions.
   - Also something that i did that really work for me is that while reading the question i started to code it so that i dont take a lot of time starting the question and westing time, and that time can be use to go over the questiong and making use i hit all points.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions:
   - I Had positive thoughs in my head although some times it may be imposible, but trust it really works.
   - I also try to forget that all my peers are around me so that all distracktions dont fool me :).

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: [I think i really have to improve my time management skills]
- Topic/Concept 2: [I also think that i should practice more Arrays and ArraysList strageties and others]
- Programming practice: [Use more resources that are aveilable in the internet]
